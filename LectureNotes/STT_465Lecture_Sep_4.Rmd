Check working directory to ensure we are in STT 465

JAGS: Just Another Gibbs Sample 

BUGS: Win, Open 

RStudio: key geaphical user interface 

Gibbs Sampling in R 
Belief & Probability Example 

weight~height +epsilon_i 

control L : clear console 
q() : quit R 

open intro: online statistics book 


```{r}
cars
```

```{r}
hist(cars$weight)
plot(cars$weight)
lm(log(cars$price)~cars$weight+cars$mpgCity)
x <- table(cars$type)
barplot(x)
```

  
What we need to know for Bayesian R Class 
Vector: most work done with vectors (subsetting etc)
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,0,15)
x[x<=3]
y <- x[x<=3]
x
y
```
Functions 

```{r}
Y_first <- function(x){
  result = 5*x-1.3
  return(result)
}
Y_first(x)
```
For loops
Simulations with known PDFs 
```{r}

```
